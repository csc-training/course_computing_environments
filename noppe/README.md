# CSC Notebooks course environments

CSC Noppe is a service for providing common easy-to-use exercise environment for courses. Noppe suppors currently Jupyter Lab/Notebooks and RStudio. Current log-in options are: CSC accounts, HAKA, Virtu and MOOC.fi.
It is possible to use existing Docker containers or, if you have special requirements, you can also create the docker containers yourself. This folder here contains Dockerfiles used for CSC and University of Helsinki GIS courses.

If you want to create your own course environment, please follow the [instructions for teachers](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/noppe/guide_for_teachers/).

All environments of public applications in Noppe service can be found in https://github.com/CSCfi/notebooks-public-images.
